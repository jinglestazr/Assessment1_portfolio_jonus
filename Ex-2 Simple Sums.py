#create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.

# 1) Declaring a variable and initializing it with the integer value 8 and then displaying it in the console.

var1=8
print(var1) # we have assigned the integer '8' into a variable 'var1'

# 2) Declaring a second variable and initializing it with the integer value 10 and then displaying it in the console.

var2=10
print(var2) # we have assigned the integer '10' into a variable 'var2'


# 3) Declaring a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.

Var=(var1+var2) # we have assigned another variable 'Var' to store the sum of the variables 'var1' and 'var2'

# 4) Printing the value of the sum to the console.

print(Var) # we now add the print statement to the code so that we can display the sum of the variables stored in 'Var'
